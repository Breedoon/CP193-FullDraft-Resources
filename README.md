## HC Applications


### #biasmitigation 

> Identifying my own Sunk Cost bias of spending too much time on a malfunctioning solution and mitigating it through a strategy of an if-then plan.

### #heuristics 

> Using heuristic "visualizing the problem in a different way" to come up with DTW as a possible solution.

### #optimization 

> Inspecting DTW as an optimization technique, and modifying it and its constraints to produce desirable results.

### #organization 

> Organizing `app.py` in the Algorithm repository to be able to produce different outputs without repeating the complex calculations.

### #designthinking 

> Iteration was the only constant throughout the whole development process; but here I specifically focus on how I was choosing the best way to represent word location for highlighting in the App by first attempting the built-in solution, observing its failures and engineering a better one.
